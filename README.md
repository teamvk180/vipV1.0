# virtual interface programming language
## a language just like ruby but faster than ruby 

```ruby
class Program 
   string data ="hellow world";
   def main()
      println(data)
      int data1 = 32 * 21 - 221
      println("result is "+data1)
    endf
end 

```
it is the next version after making vip compiled one
